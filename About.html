                        Brackets has some unique features like Quick Edit, Live Preview and others that you may not find in other
                        editors. Brackets is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That means that most of you using Brackets
                        have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor. In fact, we use Brackets every day to build
                        Brackets. To learn more about how to use the key features, read on. <br><br><br>

                        In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
                        Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
                        Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder. <br><br>
